# MoneFi
MoneFi is a Texas based, Fintech startup focused on facilitating a borrower-lender connections. It provides transparent loan comparisons, and secure international payment capabilities. Due to the proprietary nature of the code only selected, approved snippets of my code can be shared in this repository. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and ReactJS code.

My responsibility at MoneFi was to develope a Risk Score calculator that created a Risk Assessment in order for lenders to make informed decisions on loans that can be offered to borrowers. Due to the nature of the code I can only share so much on this specific feature as far as code, but will provide screenshots to display the functionality. I also took on the creation of the Borrowers Dashboard which worked as a hub for the borrower so that they can see active loan applications, financial goals, application documents, credit score and other important information pertaining to their profile.




• Implemented a dynamic point system to calculate users' Risk Scores, enabling precise categorization
into low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk borrowers to allow loan officers to make informed decisions.

• Responsible for the development of the Borrowers Dashboard, creating reusable React components
to display loan information, documentation and credit information on the borrower. 

• Designed an intuitive and interactive UI using React.js, which enables lenders to view and effortlessly
modify Risk Profiles, ensuring a more accurate representation of the user's Risk Score.

• Created a streamlined filter in SQL enabling lenders to effortlessly display Risk Profiles based on
various risk assessment categories.

• Crafted a seamless service layer, models, and API controllers in C# and .NET to connect with the
database, facilitating smooth information input and retrieval.

• Coordinate peer developers on overall design and standardization of project components and overall look.

• Document best practices and project coding standards.

• Lead daily code review sessions and productivity meetings with peer developers.

• Complete weekly pull requests to production with manager and peer reviews using GitHub.

• Conduct technical training lectures and code troubleshooting sessions with peer developers.



Here is a look at what a user may see on their Borrowers Dashboard upon logging in:
Upon logging in they are able to see their most recent loan application as well as other useful information to them with a few neat tools they can use to their advantage.

If a user is not yet set up with a Risk Profile they will be redirected to this page in order to get them started upon logging in.

Once a user begins to fill out personal information the form begins to populate and gives them a preview on what their Risk Score may be.

If needed you can go into their Risk Profile and adjust their scores to be more accurately respresented
